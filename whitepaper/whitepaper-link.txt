# ðŸ“˜ Mars Token (MTN) â€” WhitePaper

---

## 1. Introduction

Mars Token (MTN) is a decentralized, community-driven meme token launched on the Base blockchain.

The project was created to offer a transparent, fair, and accessible cryptocurrency experience without presales, private sales, or centralized control.

Mars Token officially launched on February 25, 2025 through a public liquidity pool on Uniswap V2 (Base Network).

The mission of Mars Token is to build a sustainable and fun ecosystem powered by its community, embracing the open spirit of decentralized finance (DeFi).

## 2. Problem Statement

Many cryptocurrency projects face issues such as unfair token distribution, centralized control, hidden private sales, and high transaction costs.

Mars Token addresses these problems by:

- Launching 100% publicly through a decentralized liquidity pool  
- Eliminating taxes on buys and sells  
- Removing team allocation and privileged wallets  
- Empowering fair access to all participants via Uniswap  
- Building trust through transparency and equal opportunity

## 3. Technology

Mars Token operates on the Base blockchain, a Layer 2 solution built on top of Ethereum and backed by Coinbase.

Base provides:

- Extremely low transaction fees  
- Fast block confirmation times  
- High scalability and throughput  
- Full compatibility with Ethereum-based tools and wallets  

The decision to launch on Base was made to provide an affordable and scalable experience for all users, including newcomers and small holders.
